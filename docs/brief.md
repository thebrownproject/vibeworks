## Problem Statement

Architecture offices in Victoria currently operate with "vibes-based" project management that creates significant operational challenges and prevents effective capacity planning. Staff receive urgent work requests via email and phone calls that interrupt planned project work, leading to systematic delays in scheduled projects regardless of accurate time estimates.

**Current State Pain Points:**
- **Documentation Gap:** Verbal requests and phone calls create undocumented urgent work that disrupts planned schedules
- **Visibility Crisis:** Management lacks real-time insight into "hours to next stage" across all active projects
- **Forecasting Impossibility:** Without systematic capture of actual time spent, future capacity planning relies on guesswork
- **Tool Resistance:** Previous attempts with platforms like Notion failed due to complexity and friction during busy periods

**Quantified Impact:**
- Projects consistently pushed back due to urgent interruptions, not poor estimates (primary delay cause identified)
- Communication gaps occur when phone calls bypass email documentation systems
- Monday morning capacity assessment requires manual polling of staff rather than dashboard visibility
- Stressed staff avoid updating systems when speed is critical, exactly when documentation is most needed

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**
- Generic project management tools don't understand architecture workflow patterns (7-stage project lifecycle)
- Traditional interfaces require learning curves that busy staff resist during urgent periods
- Complex feature sets create friction when simplicity and speed are paramount
- Tools designed for software/general business don't leverage CAD/BIM mental models staff already possess

**Urgency for Solution:**
The architecture industry's project-based nature with external deadlines means poor capacity management directly impacts client relationships and profitability. With staff comfortable in CAD platforms but resistant to traditional PM tools, there's a specific window to introduce AI-assisted management that eliminates learning curves while providing systematic tracking.

## Proposed Solution

VibeWorks addresses the project management challenges through a streamlined digital whiteboard that replicates the physical office whiteboard organization, enhanced by a simple AI chatbot for rapid task capture. The core solution centers on familiar project organization (Town Planning, Working Drawings, Harnest sections, Commercial Shop Fitouts) with basic AI assistance for common queries and task creation.

**Core Concept & Approach:**
- **Digital Whiteboard Replica:** Main interface mirrors the existing physical office whiteboard with projects organized by type and stage, providing zero learning curve
- **Basic AI Chat Overlay:** Simple chatbot for quick task creation, project queries, and basic email processing without complex conversation features
- **Simplified Architecture Workflow:** Focus on the two main workflow sections (Town Planning and Working Drawings) rather than all 7 stages for MVP speed

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Familiar Organization:** Digital replica of existing whiteboard eliminates learning curve and provides immediate familiarity
- **Rapid Task Capture:** Basic AI assistance enables 30-second task creation for urgent interruptions
- **Essential Features Only:** Focused on core workflow needs without feature bloat that caused previous tool failures
- **Real-World Validation:** Developed and tested with actual office colleagues for authentic user feedback

**Why This Solution Will Succeed:**
- **Eliminates Friction During Critical Moments:** Busy staff can quickly process urgent requests without navigating complex interfaces
- **Leverages Existing Mental Models:** CAD-familiar interface patterns reduce cognitive load and resistance
- **Transforms Overhead into Assistance:** Fast input means tracking becomes helpful rather than burdensome
- **Provides Immediate Value:** Monday morning capacity dashboard solves urgent management need

**High-Level Product Vision:**
VibeWorks becomes the single point of truth for project status, capacity management, and task coordination, transforming the architecture office from reactive "vibes-based" management to proactive, data-informed planning while respecting staff workflows and interface preferences.
