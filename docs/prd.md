# VibeWorks Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
Based on the updated Project Brief, here are the key desired outcomes combining workplace utility with portfolio demonstration:

• **Workplace Implementation:** Replace "vibes-based" project management at Fraser's current architecture office with digital replica of existing physical whiteboard, serving 8-12 colleagues with measurable productivity improvements
• **Portfolio Demonstration:** Showcase modern full-stack development skills through real-world problem-solving, demonstrating React/TypeScript/Supabase proficiency for IT industry career transition
• **Colleague Adoption Success:** Achieve 80% adoption rate (6+ of 8-12 staff) within 2 months by leveraging AI interface and CAD-familiar patterns, proving superior adoption compared to previous Notion failure
• **Measurable Business Impact:** Reduce Monday morning planning time by 60% (from 30+ to 12 minutes) and capture 90% of urgent interruptions systematically, providing quantifiable portfolio evidence
• **Technical Excellence:** Deliver professional-quality codebase with comprehensive documentation, testing, and deployment practices that demonstrate IT industry readiness
• **Career Transition Evidence:** Create compelling GitHub repository with real user adoption metrics, supervisor testimonials, and business impact data suitable for technical interviews
• **Real-World Validation:** Enable 30-second task capture speed while maintaining code quality standards that showcase both user experience design and technical implementation skills

### Background Context

VibeWorks serves a dual purpose: solving real operational challenges at Fraser's current architecture workplace while demonstrating practical software development capabilities for career transition from architecture to IT. Fraser's part-time contracting position (2 days/week) provides unique insight into genuine project management pain points, enabling development of a solution that addresses authentic workplace problems rather than theoretical business cases.

**Workplace Context:** Fraser's architecture office currently uses a physical whiteboard for project organization with sections for different work types and major clients (Working Drawings, Town Planning, Harnest projects, Commercial shop fitouts). Manual Monday morning capacity assessments and urgent work interruptions disrupt planned schedules. Previous attempts with complex tools like Notion failed due to adoption resistance, highlighting the need for familiar, intuitive interfaces.

**Portfolio Context:** The solution leverages modern AI and web technologies (React/TypeScript/Supabase) to demonstrate full-stack development capabilities while solving real business problems. This approach provides compelling portfolio evidence of practical problem-solving skills, user-centered design thinking, and ability to deliver measurable business value - key qualifications for IT industry roles.

**Strategic Value:** Unlike theoretical portfolio projects, VibeWorks will be validated through actual colleague adoption and productivity improvements, providing authentic testimonials and usage metrics for technical interviews. The project demonstrates Fraser's ability to bridge domain expertise with technical implementation, showcasing transferable skills and professional development practices suitable for modern development teams.

Design the portfolio dashboard for immediate capacity visibility and ensure CAD software interaction patterns are meaningfully adapted for web-based project management.

### Architect Prompt

Design the technical architecture for VibeWorks using the specified frontend-only approach with Vercel AI SDK, Supabase, and Next.js. Focus on: 1) AI integration architecture for conversational project management with database access, 2) Real-time collaboration system supporting 25 concurrent users, 3) Database schema optimized for 7-stage project lifecycle and task management, 4) Component architecture for dual-interface experience. Address Australian data residency, performance targets (3s AI response, 2s dashboard load), and scalability for architecture office workflows.
