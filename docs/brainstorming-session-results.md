## Technique Sessions

### First Principles Thinking - 15 minutes

**Description:** Breaking down core fundamentals of what the project management system needs to accomplish

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Core problem identification: "vibes-based" management vs. data-driven
2. Project lifecycle stages mapping (7 distinct stages)
3. Time estimation approach: staff-input rough estimates vs. historical data
4. Urgent interruption management as primary challenge
5. Communication gap: verbal requests not documented

**Insights Discovered:**
- Projects getting pushed back due to urgent interruptions, not poor estimates
- Boss trusts staff judgment on time estimates
- Need "hours to next stage" visibility across all projects
- Email primary channel for urgent work, phone calls create documentation gaps

**Notable Connections:**
- Time management issues directly linked to lack of visibility
- Documentation gap creates forecasting impossibility
- Trust in staff estimates more important than system accuracy

### Role Playing - 20 minutes

**Description:** Exploring different user perspectives within the architecture office workflow

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Boss Monday morning dashboard needs: simple, friction-free capacity view
2. Staff resistance patterns: Notion failure due to complexity and friction
3. CAD/BIM interface familiarity: ribbon UI and properties panels
4. Stressed staff workflow: speed of adding tasks as critical success factor
5. External stakeholder management: builders/consultants through staff only

**Insights Discovered:**
- Previous Notion implementation failed due to user resistance
- Staff comfortable with CAD platforms (Revit, AutoCAD) - leverage familiar patterns
- Speed of input transforms overhead into helpful tool
- External users don't need direct access - simplifies user base

**Notable Connections:**
- Interface familiarity directly impacts adoption success
- Busy moments are make-or-break for tool acceptance
- Simple dashboard requirements align with CAD workflow patterns

### What If Scenarios - 15 minutes

**Description:** Exploring ambitious possibilities and edge cases for AI integration

**Ideas Generated:**
1. AI reading and understanding architectural emails automatically
2. Copy-paste email analysis with project identification and task extraction
3. AI capacity management with intelligent assignment suggestions
4. Learning patterns over time (project types, staff expertise, time estimates)
5. AI as single interface for everything - conversational project management
6. Personal assistant model with full tool use capabilities

**Insights Discovered:**
- Copy-paste approach simpler than email integration for MVP
- AI with full database tool use enables true assistance vs. just suggestions
- Conversational interface could eliminate traditional "learning new software"
- Pattern learning valuable for future but outside MVP scope

**Notable Connections:**
- AI assistant approach solves resistance problem by eliminating traditional interface learning
- Full tool use transforms AI from advisor to autonomous assistant
- MVP simplicity enables advanced features later

### SCAMPER Method - 20 minutes

**Description:** Systematically improving and refining core concepts through structured modification

**Ideas Generated:**
1. **Substitute:** AI chat window as main interface with contextual project cards
2. **Combine:** CAD-familiar ribbon interface + AI commands for dual interaction
3. **Adapt:** Architecture "layers" concept for task organization and filtering
4. **Modify:** Magnified AI contextual awareness (project stage, staff expertise, capacity)
5. **Put to other uses:** AI drafting client communication emails
6. **Eliminate:** Traditional task assignment replaced by AI preference learning
7. **Reverse:** Proactive AI status checking instead of manual updates

**Insights Discovered:**
- Live project cards appearing on demand more intuitive than static dashboard
- Ribbon + AI dual approach provides familiar backup with innovative efficiency
- Layer-based task filtering leverages existing CAD mental models
- AI contextual awareness enables intelligent suggestions vs. manual input

**Notable Connections:**
- Each SCAMPER improvement builds on CAD familiarity theme
- Advanced features create clear future roadmap without MVP bloat
- Dual interaction methods (UI + AI) solve adoption concerns
