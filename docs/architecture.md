## API Specification

REST API with standard CRUD operations:

**MVP Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/projects` - Get all active projects with whiteboard section grouping
- `POST /api/projects` - Create new project (requires: name, client_name, project_type, address fields)
- `GET /api/projects/{id}` - Get single project with full details
- `PATCH /api/projects/{id}` - Update project (stage, status, activity_status, address)
- `GET /api/projects/{id}/tasks` - Get tasks for specific project
- `POST /api/projects/{id}/tasks` - Create task for project
- `GET /api/tasks` - Get all tasks across projects (for task board view)
- `PATCH /api/tasks/{id}` - Update task status, assignment, completion
- `POST /api/ai/chat` - Simple AI chat interactions

## Whiteboard Organization Logic

The digital whiteboard organizes projects into sections based on their `project_type` and `current_stage`:

### **Regular Projects (project_type: 'regular')**
Simplified into two main office workflow sections:
- **Town Planning** - Early stage projects (concept through building permit)
- **Working Drawings** - Documentation stage projects (tender through final drawings)

### **Harnest Projects (project_type: 'harnest')**
Special client with dedicated sections:
- **Harnest TP** - Town Planning projects (`whiteboard_section: 'harnest_tp'`)
- **Harnest WD** - Working Drawings projects (`whiteboard_section: 'harnest_wd'`)

### **Shop Fitout Projects (project_type: 'shop_fitout')**
All grouped together regardless of stage:
- **Commercial Shop Fitouts** - (`whiteboard_section: 'commercial_fitouts'`)

### **Activity Filtering**
Only projects with `activity_status: 'active'` are displayed on the whiteboard. Projects marked as 'not_active' or 'archived' are filtered out of the main view.
